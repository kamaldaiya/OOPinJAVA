IMPORTANT: 
1. The same programming problem will be sent to all your batchmates. Any indication of co-operation between a group of people will disqualify the entire group. It is expected that the problem is done independently with only the internet and books as an aid.
2. Send me the email of whatever you are able to do. Make your best attempt.

Thanks for considering PPS for your career. We are interviewing you for the position of a Developer at PaniPuri Soft Limited. In order to be considered for the position, we would like you to complete a programming problem and submit the solution to us.

Please find below the problem statement for the programming problem.

Part 0

1. Create a console application in Java. Preferably using eclipse.
2. No user input should be required to run the program.

Part 1 - Classes

1. Implement Classes to represent three Shapes Circle, Triangle and Rectangle
2. Each of the classes should be able to calculate the area and perimeter of the respective shape.
3. Each class should be able to keep track of the number of objects created for that particular class.
4. Each object created though your classes should have a unique identifier which is read-only. 
5. Each class should be able to produce a string description of the object.
6. Your classes should be able to keep track of the total number of objects created through them. For Example if you created 1 circle and 2 rectangles then the total number of shapes is 3. You should be able to get this number at through a function call.

Part 2 - Main Function

1. Create total 10 objects of the different shape classes created in Part 1.
2. Print the total number of objects created.
3. Print the total number of Circle Objects created.
4. Print the total number of Triangle Objects created.
5. Print the total number of Rectangle objects Created.
6. Place the objects in a data structure and sort so that the objects are arranged in descending order according to their area.
7. Print the descriptions of all the Shapes in the data structure in the descending order of Area.

Sample output from the program

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Number of shapes is 6

Number of circles is 1

Number of triangles is 2

Number of rectangles is 3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorted By Largest Area First:

Rectangle Id: 6 Area: 300.0 and Perimeter: 70.0

Circle    Id: 1 Area: 153.9 and Perimeter: 44.0

Rectangle Id: 5 Area: 150.0 and Perimeter: 50.0

Triangle  Id: 3 Area: 59.5 and Perimeter: 52.0

Rectangle Id: 4 Area: 50.0 and Perimeter: 30.0

Triangle  Id: 2 Area: 6.0 and Perimeter: 12.0
